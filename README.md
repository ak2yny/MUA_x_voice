[MarvelMods](https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php?topic=11070)


## Zsnd Instructions
- Convert sound files to WAV 16bit.
- To add the WAV files, drag and drop the converted WAV files on x_voice.bat and follow the instructions.
- To build the x_voice.zss, drag and drop x_voice.json on x_voice.bat.


## Credits
- Game developers in the voice, music, and sound compartments for XML, XML2, MUA, MUA2, and many other games
- Voice talents, especially Ceamonks890, for providing callouts and break lines
- Teancum, for tutorials and researching sounds
- Winstrol, for making sound modding possible
- nikita488, for Zsnd (what this package is built on)
- nodoubt_jr, for the original x_voice
- BLaw and fox456, for the latest official x_voice
- UltraMegaMagnus (and Jaybird), for the latest unofficial x_voice
- Anyone making character and/or sound mods. Sorry for not giving credits to everybody by name. You know who you are.


## Notes
- A ZSM/ZSS file is automatically created. (You'll be asked for the extension, if the filename doesn't end in `_m` or `_v` or isn't `x_voice` or `x_common`.)
- Options can be predefined in the settings, which can be found in the top section of the bat.
- Ask ak2yny if you want to know more about the settings.
- If you prefer a different style of callouts (e.g. Ceamonks890's) check the JSON folder for details of sounds that are already included. Be aware that these lists have a different index. You can also add to one of the lists in the JSON folder (they all work by themselves), but you have to provide the hash and file details for added files.
